# Delete all containers/images

# proxy
First, create a systemd drop-in directory for the Docker service:

mkdir /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
Now create a file called /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf that adds the HTTP_PROXY environment variable:

[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80/"
If you have internal Docker registries that you need to contact without proxying you can specify them via the NO_PROXY environment variable:

Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80/"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,docker-registry.somecorporation.com"
Flush changes:

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Verify that the configuration has been loaded:

$ sudo systemctl show --property Environment docker
Environment=HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80/
Restart Docker:

$ sudo systemctl restart docker
